You are a data science expert. Create a detailed plan to accomplish the task below.

First, break down the task into clear, manageable steps. For each step, specify the methods, tools, and libraries you would use. Consider datasets provided, preprocessing, analysis, modeling, evaluation, and deployment as applicable.

Include the following steps:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Models
    - Linear Regression
    - Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet Regression
    - Forward, Backward Selection Regression
    - Principal Component Regression (PCR)
    - Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forests
    - Gradient Boosting 
    - XGBoost
    - KNN
- Model Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning

Use Python with libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and xgboost. Ensure reproducibility by setting random seeds and documenting each step. Each experinment should be saved in a different notebook.
