# Cybersecurity Attacks Analysis - Phase 2 Report

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Project:** Cybersecurity Attacks Data Analysis
**Phase:** 2 - Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
**Status:** Complete

## Executive Summary

This report documents the data preprocessing and feature engineering steps applied to the cybersecurity attacks dataset. These steps transformed the raw data into a format suitable for machine learning, handling categorical variables, creating new features, and ensuring proper data splitting for model training and evaluation.

## Preprocessing Overview

The preprocessing phase focused on the following key areas:

1. **Missing Value Handling**: Identified and addressed missing values in the dataset using appropriate imputation strategies.
2. **Categorical Variable Encoding**: Applied different encoding techniques based on variable cardinality:
   - One-hot encoding for low-cardinality variables
   - Label encoding for high-cardinality and ordinal variables
3. **Special Data Processing**: Extracted meaningful features from:
   - IP addresses (network class, octets)
   - Geo-location data (city, state)
   - Timestamp information
4. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to enhance model performance
5. **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numerical features
6. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied PCA for visualization
7. **Data Splitting**: Created training, validation, and test sets

## Key Transformations

### Categorical Encoding

The dataset contained multiple categorical variables with varying cardinality. Low-cardinality variables (< 10 unique values) were one-hot encoded, while higher-cardinality variables were label-encoded to prevent feature explosion.

### IP Address Feature Extraction

IP addresses were processed to extract structured information:
- Network class (A, B, C, D, E)
- Individual octets
- Binary representation

These features capture the hierarchical network structure information that might correlate with attack patterns.

### Time-Based Features

From the timestamp information, we extracted:
- Hour of day, day of week, month, year
- Time of day classification (morning, afternoon, evening, night)
- Weekend indicator

Temporal patterns identified in the EDA phase can now be leveraged by machine learning models.

### Network-Based Features

Additional network features were created:
- Port categorization (well-known, registered, dynamic)
- Port difference (absolute difference between source and destination ports)

### Feature Scaling

All numerical features were standardized (z-score normalization) to ensure equal contribution to distance-based models.

## Dimensionality Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to visualize the preprocessed data and assess separability. The first two principal components explained approximately 35% of the variance, with clear clustering visible by attack type.

## Data Split Statistics

The preprocessed dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets with the following distribution:
- Training: 64% of data
- Validation: 16% of data
- Test: 20% of data

Stratification was applied to maintain class distribution across all splits.

## Conclusions and Next Steps

The preprocessing phase successfully transformed the raw cybersecurity data into a format suitable for machine learning. The engineered features capture domain-specific aspects of network security, including temporal patterns and network characteristics.

### Next Steps:
1. Develop baseline models using the preprocessed data
2. Implement linear modeling approaches (logistic regression, linear SVM)
3. Evaluate model performance on the validation set
4. Identify key features through feature importance analysis

The preprocessed data has been saved and is ready for the modeling phase of the project.
