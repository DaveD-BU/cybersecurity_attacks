# Introduction

![Status: In progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20progress-yellow)

This implementation plan outlines the steps necessary to analyze the cybersecurity attacks dataset and develop machine learning models to predict attack types and severity levels. The project will follow a structured data science approach including exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development using various algorithms. Each step will be carefully documented for reproducibility and evaluation.

**Current Status:** Phase 1 (EDA), Phase 2 (Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering), and Phase 3 (Baseline Modeling and Linear Methods) completed. Ready to start Phase 4 (Advanced Machine Learning Models). Phase 7 (Comprehensive Reporting) has been added to generate detailed reports for all phases after completion.
