# Introduction

![Status: In progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20progress-yellow)

This implementation plan outlines the steps necessary to analyze the cybersecurity attacks dataset and develop machine learning models to predict attack types and severity levels. The project will follow a structured data science approach including exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development using various algorithms. Each step will be carefully documented for reproducibility and evaluation.

**Current Status:** Phases 1 and 2 are complete. Phase 3 (Baseline Modeling and Linear Methods) was rebuilt on 2025-10-17 with reproducible notebooks and artifacts. Phase 4 (Advanced Machine Learning Models) is now underway with stepwise execution in `notebooks/04_advanced_models.ipynb`. Phase 7 (Comprehensive Reporting) remains scheduled for post-modeling consolidation.
